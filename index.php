  <br>
  This is where TWSICommunity.com be once everything is transferred onto the pi. Which means this device will last longer since it's powered by a battery power bank. Plus it lasts longer and power doesn't shut off on the pi since it's on battery powered. So all data that have been stored will be kept safe during power outages.<br>
  <br>
  So in this case everything wouldn't be on an external hard drive all the time. Isn't portable great :D.</p><p align="center"><b>TWSICommunity - Copyright 2017 - 2018</b></p></div>
